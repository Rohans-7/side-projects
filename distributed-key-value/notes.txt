// Notes : 
// socket - endpoint between application layer and transport
// identified using IP + port
// on socket you receive data in bytes you need to convert it
// into characters -> that's why InputStreamReader
// when creating socket, handle checked exceptions.
// Till this the application logic was simple.
// Next target : 
// 1. Making application more interactive.
// 2. Creating monolithic first and then distributed.
